# RESUME-SELECTION-MACHINE-LEARNING
Build a Machine Learning Model on Na√Øve Bayes classifier  to predict whether a given resume text should be flagged or not. Our training data consist of 125 resumes with 33 flagged resumes and 92 non-flagged resumes. Matplotliba and seaborn libraries were used for Data Visualization. Natural Processing Toolikt (NLTK) was used for pre-processing the written text (removing stop words and unnecesary words). Sklearn module in python was used to transform the training data to countvectorizer sparse matrix and train the Naive Bayes Classifier
The results of the model were as follows:
1) Accuracy (Training Dataet) : 94.0 %
2) Accuracy (Test Dataet) : 84.0 %
3) Precision Score : 0.87
4) Recall Score : 0.84
Application: This project can be used for screening/shortlisting resumes in  Univerities / Colleges / Companies / Schools.
